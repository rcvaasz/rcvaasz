  - Redshift for data warehousing.
  - Lambda for serverless computing.
  - Athena for interactive querying.
  - EMR (Elastic MapReduce) for big data processing.
  - Step Functions for orchestrating serverless workflows.

- OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure):
  - Compute instances for flexible computing.
  - Object Storage for secure data storage.
  - Autonomous Database for fully managed databases.
  - Data Integration for ETL and data movement.
  - Oracle Data Warehouse for data warehousing.
  - Functions for serverless computing.
